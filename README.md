**Architecture Style Classifier**
=====================================

**Project Overview**
-------------------

This project utilizes the Clarifai API to classify architecture styles based on image inputs. The classifier is trained to recognize three distinct styles: Modern, Victorian, and Romanesque.

**How it Works**
----------------

1. **Image Input**: Users provide an image of a building or structure as input.
2. **Clarifai API**: The image is sent to the Clarifai API for analysis.
3. **Style Classification**: The API uses machine learning algorithms to classify the image into one of the three architecture styles: Modern, Victorian, or Romanesque.
4. **Output**: The classified style is returned to the user, along with a confidence score indicating the accuracy of the classification.

**Features**
------------

* **Multi-Style Classification**: The classifier can recognize three distinct architecture styles: Modern, Victorian, and Romanesque.
* **Image-Based Input**: Users can provide images of buildings or structures as input for classification.
* **Confidence Scoring**: The classifier returns a confidence score indicating the accuracy of the classification.

**Use Cases**
-------------

* **Architecture and Design**: This project can be used by architects, designers, and builders to classify and identify different architecture styles.
* **Real Estate and Property**: The classifier can be used to identify the style of a building or property, which can be useful for real estate agents, property managers, and homeowners.
* **Education and Research**: The project can be used as a tool for teaching and researching architecture styles, history, and cultural significance.

**Technical Details**
--------------------

* **Clarifai API**: The project uses the Clarifai API for image analysis and classification.
* **Machine Learning**: The API uses machine learning algorithms to classify images into different architecture styles.
* **Image Processing**: The project uses image processing techniques to prepare images for analysis by the Clarifai API.
